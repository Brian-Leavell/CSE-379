# CSE-379 Lab 7: Breakout

## About

Thie github contains the work done by myself, Brian Leavell, and my partner, Ian Witmer. The included files show the subroutines that were individually developed and finally placed together to run the entire game.
The entire functioning program can be found inside the file titled "submittedversion".
